# TicTacToeGame
Simple console tic-tac-toe game. Use it to play with your friends or just play with computer.

## Controls
In menu use down and up arrows to choose what type of game you want to play and press enter. Than enter size of field.

When game starts input x pos and press enter, than input y pos and press enter. In the end of the game conclusion will be shown and you will be taken back to menu.

## How does it work
I registrate all possible combinations from cells * or 0 and push then into list in view {{pos},{direction}}. So than I simply registrate combinations full of * or 0.
